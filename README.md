# Employee Turnover Analysis ðŸ“ŠðŸ‘”  

Welcome to the Employee Turnover Analysis repository! This project focuses on understanding the factors contributing to employee turnover using advanced analytics and machine learning techniques. By leveraging a dataset of employee records, we explore patterns, identify critical factors, and predict turnover using a robust analysis pipeline.  

## ðŸš€ Project Overview  
This project aims to analyze employee data and predict the likelihood of turnover. Using clustering, SMOTE, and various machine learning models, we enhance predictive accuracy while ensuring balanced datasets. The project also involves detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful business insights.  

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used  
We utilized the following libraries and tools for this project:  

- **SMOTE**: To handle class imbalance in the dataset.  
- **Scikit-learn**: For feature selection, model training, evaluation, and K-Fold cross-validation.  
- **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and preprocessing.  
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and trend analysis.  
- **Clustering Algorithms**: For identifying natural groupings in the data.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals of the Project  
- **Turnover Prediction**: Build a machine learning model to predict employee turnover with high accuracy.  
- **EDA**: Perform an in-depth analysis of data to understand key trends and patterns.  
- **Clustering**: Segment employees into clusters based on similarities to gain actionable insights.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Use F1 score, recall, and other metrics to evaluate performance.  
- **Cross-Validation**: Employ K-Fold cross-validation for reliable model assessment.
